//Problem
    
    /*Given an integer n and a position i, your task is to write a program to extract the value of the i-th bit of n. The i-th bit is counted from the right, starting at position 0 (0-based indexing). Return 1 if the bit is set, otherwise return 0.
    
    Input Format
    
    A single integer n representing the number.
    A single integer i representing the bit position to extract.
    Constraints
    
    -2^31 ≤ n ≤ 2^31
    0 ≤ i ≤ 31
    Output Format
    
    Output a single integer, which is the value of the i-th bit of n (either 0 or 1)
    Sample Input 0
    
    21 2
    Sample Output 0
    
    1
    Sample Input 1
    
    0 5
    Sample Output 1
    
    0
    */

//SOLUTION

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num,i;
    scanf("%d%d",&num,&i);
    
    int x = num & (1<<i);
    
    if(x==0){
        printf("%d",0);
    }else{
        printf("%d",1);   
    }
    
    return 0;
}
