//Problem

    /*Aman has three sticks and wants to classify the shape he can form by connecting their ends. The classification is based on the following rules:
    
    The shape(triangle) is classified as:
    
    Equilateral: All three sticks are of the same length.
    Isosceles: Exactly two sticks are of the same length.
    Scalene: All three sticks have different lengths.
    However, if the sticks cannot be connected to form a triangle due to their lengths, it is classified as an Invalid shape.
    
    Aman needs a program that will take the lengths of the three sticks as input, validate if they can form a valid closed shape, and output the correct classification.
    
    Input Format
    
    Three space-separated integers (a,b,c) representing the lengths of the sticks.
    
    Constraints
    
    1 <= a, b, c <= 10^6
    
    Output Format
    
    Print 3 different messages based on the input:
    
    Lengths of the Sticks:
    "Lengths: [a, b, c]"
    Triangle Type:
    "Type: Equilateral"
    "Type: Isosceles"
    "Type: Scalene"
    "Type: Invalid"
    Shape Characteristics:
    "All sides are of the same length."
    "Exactly two sides are equal."
    "All sides are of different lengths."
    "Cannot form a valid shape."
    Sample Input 0
    
    6 6 6
    Sample Output 0
    
    Lengths: [6, 6, 6]  
    Type: Equilateral  
    All sides are of the same length.  
    Sample Input 1
    
    8 8 10
    Sample Output 1
    
    Lengths: [8, 8, 10]  
    Type: Isosceles  
    Exactly two sides are equal.  
    Sample Input 2
    
    5 9 7
    Sample Output 2
    
    Lengths: [5, 9, 7]  
    Type: Scalene  
    All sides are of different lengths.  
    Sample Input 3
    
    1 2 3
    Sample Output 3
    
    Lengths: [1, 2, 3]  
    Type: Invalid  
    Cannot form a valid shape.
