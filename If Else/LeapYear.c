//Problem

/*  A year is considered a leap year if:
    
    It is divisible by 4.
    However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.
    Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not, outputs the result in a specific format, and handles invalid years as well.
    
    Input Format
    
    A single integer Y representing the year.
    Constraints
    
    −10^5 ≤ Y ≤ 10^5
    
    Output Format
    
    Print "The given year [Y] is Invalid year." if the year is invalid.
    Print "Yes, [Y] is a leap year." if the year is a leap year.
    Print "No, [Y] is not a leap year." otherwise.
    Sample Input 0
    
    2024
    Sample Output 0
    
    Yes, 2024 is a leap year.
    Sample Input 1
    
    2001
    Sample Output 1
    
    No, 2001 is not a leap year.
    Sample Input 2
    
    -234
    Sample Output 2
    
    The given year -234 is Invalid year.
*/

//Solution

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int year;
    scanf("%d",&year);
    if(year<=0){
        printf("The given year %d is Invalid year.", year);
        return 0;
    }
    else if(year%400==0 || (year%4==0 && year%100!=0)){
        printf("Yes, %d is a leap year.", year);
    }
    else{
        printf("No, %d is not a leap year.", year);
    }
    return 0;
}
